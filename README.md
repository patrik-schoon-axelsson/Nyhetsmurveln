# NYHETSMURVELN - "The News Hound"
A small full-stack app, comprising of a MongoDB-Flask API, to feed JSON-data into JS Frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, Angular et-all. I decided to build it partly because I wanted to get a better idea on how to implement JWT in practice, partly to have a large, diverse JSON-dataset to work with when writing FrontEnd projects.

Also, it'll make reading the morning news a lot easier for me. Bonus!

## Installation instructions

To run locally, clone the repo and execute the following commands.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd frontend

npm run install

npm build

```

Once the frontend has been generated by npm build, you can run the app by executing either of the following in the root directory:

```

python3 app.py

flask run

```
